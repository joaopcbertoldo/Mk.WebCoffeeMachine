# MKafeina
Project of a coffee machine connected to the internet.

"MK" is the abbreviation of "Mechatronics".
"Cafeína" is the brazilian word for "caffeine".

This project was inspired for the ultimate need for coffee of the mechatronics engineering students at the University of São Paulo... Therefore:

MK + Cafeína = MKafeina!

Offline coffee machines are dead, long live MKafeina.

TODO: clean up this repo.
